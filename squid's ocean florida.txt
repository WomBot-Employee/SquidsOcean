Day 1. This is a new place, and odd place too. I only have one companion, ash. But he‚Äôs rarely alive. I regret that your mom joke but it is what it is, I will be used to it soon. Besides, this will be my home for a long time, almost forever, I might never leave. I don‚Äôt see a way to escape but I‚Äôll look tomorrow. -E


[29-May-22 09:14 PM] parzival#8652
I‚Äôve only spent 40 minutes up here‚Ä¶ or down here. I cannot tell. It‚Äôs been a horribly boring time. There is quite nothing to do but count bricks they make up the walls. Quite boring. I can barely survive 40 minutes. How am I supposed to survive longer? Also there is sadly no sleep medication. I would ask a warden for one but @Squid is the only one. He hasn‚Äôt came by a single time. This will be quite the lonely time. At most I can hope for sleep deprivation to kill me. Food and water just kinda *poof* into existence. It‚Äôs happend only one time. It was quite the sight to see. -E


[30-May-22 10:33 AM] parzival#8652
Day 2, well after several hours I managed to fall asleep. I woke up to more food and water. I isn‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible. But it did came with an spoon for this soupish like thing. It made a small dent in the wall but it like disappears with the food treys. It‚Äôs really weird. I have no freinds here and only concrete floor. A single lightbulb. And walls, not a single window. I‚Äôm starting to suffer from altitude sickness, or I‚Äôm just homesick. Probably both. -E

I just woke up, it‚Äôs horrible. Several phones taped to the walls, its horrible, it‚Äôs just playing plushy videos. It‚Äôs quite interesting when you don‚Äôt look at the plushies, the back round is cool. But I tried to take Em down, they were stuck.

[02-Jun-22 08:33 AM] parzival#8652
I don‚Äôt know how it happens but somehow the warden just changed how they look, I can believe it‚Äôs plastic surgery or were in a simulation. -E

I no longer know how long I‚Äôve been in here. I just sleep when I‚Äôm tired, there‚Äôs really no way for me to tell. I don‚Äôt know if even any will every see me or these writings again. I think I know a way out. I‚Äôll have to learn how to lock pick. On my own.

[03-Jun-22 01:35 PM] parzival#8652
Welp, I‚Äôm hiding my writings from now on


[04-Jun-22 11:43 AM] parzival#8652
Welp I‚Äôve hidden everything I had under a loose floorboard. Under it it‚Äôs just concrete, can‚Äôt tunnel out anymore. I think maybe something with the roof or just the main door. -E


[08-Jun-22 07:47 PM] parzival#8652
Well, I forgot to address what I have, I have a small paper clip, and some paper and a pen. I was writing when I was transported. It‚Äôs been a while sense I‚Äôve written.

I actually feel quite peace of mind here, it‚Äôs a nice place to think. No distractions, no loud noises, and it‚Äôs just quiet. I‚Äôm actually starting to enjoy it here, -E


[12-Jun-22 10:43 AM] parzival#8652
In starting to feel homesick, just thinking about the pleasures of the outside world. Are my freinds and family dead? Will i ever see them Again? I suppose it‚Äôs up to fate.


[18-Jun-22 05:23 PM] parzival#8652
I believe I will die here, I‚Äôm not going to eat my food. I will die eventually. -E

[01-Jul-22 12:42 PM] parzival#8652
Welp I had some freedom for a second. I was even downloading pictures to post. That I drew of course. It would‚Äôve been fun. I can‚Äôt change it sadly. Sadly death is not an option. I will spend eternity here, perhaps I‚Äôll try my silver tongue to convince them to let me out. -E

I would like to schedule a teleconference to see if I could possibly leave and into house arrest. I would be trapped but I‚Äôd have company. Sadly it won‚Äôt work. They wouldn‚Äôt let me schedule a teleconference. Shame. -E


[04-Jul-22 01:44 AM] parzival#8652
Well turns out a warden had some stream, I don‚Äôt know what it was about but I sure missed it. To busy playing solitaire on my solar powered I pod. -E

Today I discovered something. It‚Äôs called photic sneeze reflex. Basically you sneeze when your in a bright area. It only effects 17 to like 35% of people. I‚Äôm also pretty sure it‚Äôs a kinda of mutation. Does that mean I‚Äôm an X-Men? -E

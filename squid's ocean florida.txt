Day 1. This is a new place, and odd place too. I only have one companion, ash. But he’s rarely alive. I regret that your mom joke but it is what it is, I will be used to it soon. Besides, this will be my home for a long time, almost forever, I might never leave. I don’t see a way to escape but I’ll look tomorrow. -E


[29-May-22 09:14 PM] parzival#8652
I’ve only spent 40 minutes up here… or down here. I cannot tell. It’s been a horribly boring time. There is quite nothing to do but count bricks they make up the walls. Quite boring. I can barely survive 40 minutes. How am I supposed to survive longer? Also there is sadly no sleep medication. I would ask a warden for one but @Squid is the only one. He hasn’t came by a single time. This will be quite the lonely time. At most I can hope for sleep deprivation to kill me. Food and water just kinda *poof* into existence. It’s happend only one time. It was quite the sight to see. -E


[30-May-22 10:33 AM] parzival#8652
Day 2, well after several hours I managed to fall asleep. I woke up to more food and water. I isn’t know how it’s possible. But it did came with an spoon for this soupish like thing. It made a small dent in the wall but it like disappears with the food treys. It’s really weird. I have no freinds here and only concrete floor. A single lightbulb. And walls, not a single window. I’m starting to suffer from altitude sickness, or I’m just homesick. Probably both. -E

I just woke up, it’s horrible. Several phones taped to the walls, its horrible, it’s just playing plushy videos. It’s quite interesting when you don’t look at the plushies, the back round is cool. But I tried to take Em down, they were stuck.

Day 3, the wardens are quite rude here. About what you’d expect, correcting my grammar, spelling, it’s bad. And there are more plushie things. -E

It will keep me entertained, but the wardens are still rude. Pep and squid. -E

[02-Jun-22 08:33 AM] parzival#8652
I don’t know how it happens but somehow the warden just changed how they look, I can believe it’s plastic surgery or were in a simulation. -E

I no longer know how long I’ve been in here. I just sleep when I’m tired, there’s really no way for me to tell. I don’t know if even any will every see me or these writings again. I think I know a way out. I’ll have to learn how to lock pick. On my own.

You saw that?


[03-Jun-22 01:35 PM] parzival#8652
Welp, I’m hiding my writings from now on


[04-Jun-22 11:43 AM] parzival#8652
Welp I’ve hidden everything I had under a loose floorboard. Under it it’s just concrete, can’t tunnel out anymore. I think maybe something with the roof or just the main door. -E


[08-Jun-22 07:47 PM] parzival#8652
Well, I forgot to address what I have, I have a small paper clip, and some paper and a pen. I was writing when I was transported. It’s been a while sense I’ve written.

[11-Jun-22 08:10 AM] parzival#8652
I actually feel quite peace of mind here, it’s a nice place to think. No distractions, no loud noises, and it’s just quiet. I’m actually starting to enjoy it here, -E


[12-Jun-22 10:43 AM] parzival#8652
In starting to feel homesick, just thinking about the pleasures of the outside world. Are my freinds and family dead? Will i ever see them Again? I suppose it’s up to fate.


[18-Jun-22 05:23 PM] parzival#8652
I believe I will die here, I’m not going to eat my food. I will die eventually. -E

Can you delete all of those


[01-Jul-22 12:39 PM] parzival#8652
No?


[01-Jul-22 12:40 PM] parzival#8652
Ok 🙁


[01-Jul-22 12:42 PM] parzival#8652
Welp I had some freedom for a second. I was even downloading pictures to post. That I drew of course. It would’ve been fun. I can’t change it sadly. Sadly death is not an option. I will spend eternity here, perhaps I’ll try my silver tongue to convince them to let me out. -E

I would like to schedule a teleconference to see if I could possibly leave and into house arrest. I would be trapped but I’d have company. Sadly it won’t work. They wouldn’t let me schedule a teleconference. Shame. -E


[04-Jul-22 01:44 AM] parzival#8652
Well turns out a warden had some stream, I don’t know what it was about but I sure missed it. To busy playing solitaire on my solar powered I pod. -E


[04-Jul-22 01:44 AM] Squid#0064
It was a bloody great stream

Today I discovered something. It’s called photic sneeze reflex. Basically you sneeze when your in a bright area. It only effects 17 to like 35% of people. I’m also pretty sure it’s a kinda of mutation. Does that mean I’m an X-Men? -E

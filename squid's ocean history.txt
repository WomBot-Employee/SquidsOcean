Miles and his bots had raided the server. The server had lasted about 2 monthes without war. This was not fun for most anybody.

It was a nice morning when Tom walked to @Squid with a proposal to merge with his kingdom. Squid declined and they played cards. When night struck fire erupted from out kingdom (Squids Ocean) walls Tom arose and he convinced people to aid his cause. @pëp @09Miles , and @PenguinBoi at one point. We closed him in a room where pep went from the second most powerful to as weak as a Bidoof the others called out but to no response. Pep walked towards Squid and asked him to let him out. He was given ultimate power back at once. The rain started getting harsh and the lightning lit the sky. Pep finally asked Tom if he wanted to be "Permanently exiled" Tom nodded and Pep brought out a sword, made of ruby, shining with rain droplets. Pep then walked through tom and all that remained were the words "I will live a hero, and die a god." and a pile of dust. Pep exited the room drenched in rain with the words “I gave up trying to go back a long time ago. And getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore, either, cause even if we do... we'll just end up right back here, without any memory of it, right? To be blunt... It makes it kind of hard to give it my all.”

@?? The real history of the server that is displayed here contributes to the ARG.

!EMERGENCY! A FIGURE HAS BEEN SPOTTED BY THE PREMISES OF THE WALL! HE CALLS HIMSELF "dad" AND INSTANTLY BECAME ALL POWERFUL! HE DISSAPEARED AFTER FIVE MINUTES AND TWENTY SEVEN SECONDS BUT HE COULD STILL BE OUT THERE! STAY INSIDE!

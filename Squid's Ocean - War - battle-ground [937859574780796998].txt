[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] Squid#0064

[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] HybridHamster#5864
Wasn‚Äôt miles on final strike?


[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] Ars√∏n#3353

[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] Squid#0064

[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
This isn‚Äôt against the rules brownie is it?


[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
This is battle ground


[16-Feb-22 05:19 PM] HybridHamster#5864

[16-Feb-22 05:20 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
They have a right to fight


[16-Feb-22 05:20 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
There were important rules that you ‚Äúforgot‚Äù about


[16-Feb-22 05:20 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
And the unfairness


[16-Feb-22 05:20 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
The unfairness that this server has


[16-Feb-22 05:20 PM] Squid#0064
ok


[16-Feb-22 05:21 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
It‚Äôs not fair!!


[16-Feb-22 05:21 PM] Squid#0064
Did you really want Miles and Tom fighting for communism


[16-Feb-22 05:21 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
They are fighting for themselves!


[16-Feb-22 05:22 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
Miles said the thingy and e said it too!!


[16-Feb-22 05:22 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
and miles got banned for 2 days


[16-Feb-22 05:22 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
And e got nothing


[16-Feb-22 05:22 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
Unfair to miles


[16-Feb-22 05:23 PM] Squid#0064
E hadn't read the rules untill that point also Miles knew he was on his last strike if he broke one rule he went bye bye


[16-Feb-22 05:23 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
That‚Äôs e‚Äôs problem


[16-Feb-22 05:23 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
That should‚Äôve been the first thing to do when entering the server


[16-Feb-22 05:23 PM] Squid#0064
He's on mobile


[16-Feb-22 05:23 PM] Squid#0064
He can't react


[16-Feb-22 05:24 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
How does he enter the chats then??


[16-Feb-22 05:24 PM] parzival#8652

[16-Feb-22 05:24 PM] parzival#8652
Thx


[16-Feb-22 05:25 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
You shouldn‚Äôt defend some who didn‚Äôt read the rules


[16-Feb-22 05:25 PM] Squid#0064
He has now


[16-Feb-22 05:25 PM] Ars√∏n#3353
You could‚Äôve told him them


[16-Feb-22 05:25 PM] parzival#8652
I did read the rules


[16-Feb-22 05:25 PM] Ars√∏n#3353

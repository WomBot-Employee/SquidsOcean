Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex
Two pickup trucks
Making love
American made
Built Ford tough
Two beautiful murder machines
American angels in the sky
Grown men cry
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (oh), my muscles (oh)
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)
Involuntarily flex
Right by my side
There's zz top
And Robert Z'Dar
From maniac cop one, two and three
This barbecue could bring you to your knees
And so could these two trucks
Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
Is more than I can withstand
Two trucks holding hands
Two trucks holding hands
The passion, the passion
My big fat heart expands
Two pickup trucks
One cylinder block
Crush my body like a rock
So beautiful
No stars tonight
Just fireworks and eagles in the sky
The founding fathers cry
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
Two trucks having sex (oh yes)
My muscles (oh) my muscles (oh)
Involuntarily flex
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah-ah-ha-ha-ha, ah-ah
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks having sex
Two trucks having sex
My muscles, my muscles
Involuntarily flex
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex)
Two trucks (having sex, having sex, having sex)

Hatsune Miku ~ Triple Baka - Full Song (English Subtitles v2)
Version 2 (Compared with more sources.)
Original: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQTZC3uNW4

http://b3net.omegasdg.com/videos/Hatsune%20Miku%20-%20Triple%20Baka%20(Subbed%20by%20Seisatsu).mp4

It took about an hour to add the subtitles.

I started by using previous translations for reference:

[04-Apr-22 07:25 PM] dumit#6548
do I need to explain?


[04-Apr-22 07:31 PM] Squid#0064
elaborate


[04-Apr-22 08:05 PM] dumit#6548
shaggy and scooby always run away side by side when fleeing in terror from a monster. if a great dane‚Äôs running is 30-40 mph that means that shaggy can run at the same speed. this means that shaggy is the fastest human alive beating usain bolts top speed of 27 mph

My friend‚Äôs toe might be broken and I blame myself


[06-Apr-22 03:55 PM] Squid#0064
Elaborate?


[06-Apr-22 03:56 PM] p√´p#1005
So we were filming a movie for a class project thing and we were setting up a green screen, so friend2,  toefriend and me were pushing a table to make room, but the table fell over because it stopped moving so we started to push at a weird angle, and it fell, and toefriend tried to catch it but it slammed on his toe


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] p√´p#1005
I think the table weighed at least 100 lbs


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Squid#0064
It's friend1s fault


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] p√´p#1005
?


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Squid#0064
Wait


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Squid#0064
No


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] p√´p#1005
I would be friend1 in this


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Squid#0064
Friend2


[06-Apr-22 03:57 PM] p√´p#1005
How so?


[06-Apr-22 03:58 PM] Squid#0064
Think about it if he wasn't there you wouldn't be able to move the table In that way


[06-Apr-22 03:59 PM] p√´p#1005
Well we still could, it would just be slower and require more effort, also if I wasn‚Äôt there according to your argument it wouldn‚Äôt have happened


[06-Apr-22 03:59 PM] Squid#0064
True but there were 3 people there correct?


[06-Apr-22 03:59 PM] p√´p#1005
Yes


[06-Apr-22 03:59 PM] Squid#0064
There's only a 33% chance it's your fault


[06-Apr-22 04:00 PM] p√´p#1005
Well one person will have more than 33.3% of the blame anyway


[06-Apr-22 04:00 PM] p√´p#1005
33.3 x 3 is 99.9


[06-Apr-22 04:00 PM] p√´p#1005
Someone will be the 33.4


[06-Apr-22 04:00 PM] Squid#0064
Did the table fall opposite from you?


[06-Apr-22 04:00 PM] p√´p#1005
Ye


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] p√´p#1005
We were all on the same side


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] Squid#0064
How did it fall on his toe?


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] p√´p#1005
He tried to catch it


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] p√´p#1005
When it fell


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] Squid#0064
Then it's his fault


[06-Apr-22 04:01 PM] p√´p#1005
Nvm I just take the blame cause I didn‚Äôt do anything to help


[06-Apr-22 04:02 PM] Squid#0064
Well what really could you have done?


[06-Apr-22 04:03 PM] Squid#0064
Broken both your feet?


[06-Apr-22 04:03 PM] p√´p#1005
Well I mean friend 2 helped get his stuff and friend3 who wasn‚Äôt there when the table fell but came after it fell helped friend2 get tape for his temporary bandage


[06-Apr-22 04:03 PM] p√´p#1005
And I‚Äôm incompetent and failed to get tape


[06-Apr-22 04:03 PM] Squid#0064
It was the shock pep the shock


[06-Apr-22 04:03 PM] p√´p#1005

[06-Apr-22 04:04 PM] Squid#0064
The shock from the foot broken


[06-Apr-22 04:04 PM] Squid#0064

I know this venting chat isn‚Äôt very serious but I just want to say what happened today.

So basically in German we were getting our assigned seats. When we got our seats I was seated next to my best friend. I saw she looked like she didn‚Äôt want to be next to me. So I asked her if she was okay. And she said yeah. And when we got on the bus I asked her if she was okay in German because I noticed she wasn‚Äôt very happy. She said yes again. But then I asked if she wanted to sit with ____. She said ‚ÄúYeah, I like sitting next to you but I want to be with her‚Äù. That hurt. She was unhappy because she was seated next to me. And now I feel like she likes her new friends more than me. It really hurts. I try to make her laugh at school but she just talks with small sentences and doesn‚Äôt try to keep the conversation going. I want to tell her what she‚Äôs doing to my emotions, but idk how she will react

So basically today I brought my pride flag to school and yk, wore it. This boy comes up to me and says my flag is ugly. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but that was just the beginning of his homophobic comments about me and my flag and friends. He said ‚ÄúAhhhhh the colors are too bright!‚Äù. He started covering his eyes so he couldn‚Äôt see it. Much more happened but it‚Äôs really bad. And the principal started coming up to me a lot throughout the school day saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have that out, you need to put it in your locker‚Äù. I thought he was talking about my bag. But he just started asking if the flag could fit because I was still carrying it around. 

I knew there are homophobic people at school but I didn‚Äôt expect them to target ME and my FRIENDS with me. It  really hurts because I felt so happy and proud with my flag even though I was having a shitty fucking day. But the words that came out hurt me like a knife.


[05-May-22 08:28 PM] Ars√∏n#3353

half my city is entirely out of power during a heat wave. It was almost 100 degrees out and it felt even hotter. During the outage, traffic was insane because most of the lights weren't working. Some stores had no power but stayed open, while others straight up shut down. I was left without power all of yesterday and until now toady, and it was quite painful. We all had to cram sleeping in the basement because it was too hot upstairs to even think. It was miserable, but now I know how some people feel, and I'm glad about how lucky I am, even with a poor family


[15-Jun-22 08:59 PM] dumit#6548
we were out of power because the grid was overwhelmed by everyone's usage. To not cause a statewide blackout, they instead shut select grids off to save energy

my idea for a documentry is about a man named Robert Phillip in Arlington, Tennessee , who takes his money and buys two cows to milk and milk more money. the first day, he milks 740 gallons. for a dollar a gallon. he repeats that every morning and milks the cows. in the summer, he milks 14000 gallons. for three dollars a gallon. every morning, he makes $16000 a year. by the end of the season, he makes $100,000,00. by the end of the 10 years, he makes $250,000,000.
